# WOW_Map
Single page web application inspired by a front-end development exam (javascript and jQuery)

The web page contains a very large map, only a part of it can be seen through a window. Next to it, there is a list of places. When you click on a place, the map moves so the window is centered on this place.
This is inspired by my 2nd year front-end development exam. I really enjoyed this exam with the Middle-earth map, so I decided to redo a similar web application but with a different map.
